# ML-Lab

This is a Machine Learning laboratory to explore some concept through exercises, small projects and tutorials :)

Decision Tree              | Construct a model of decisions made based on actual values of attributes in the data |[rees](https://github.com/Luisa13/ML-Lab/tree/main/Decision%20Trees)
Bayesian                   | Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem for problems such as classification and regression              |
Clustering                 | Describes the class of problem and the class of methods                              |
Artificial Neural Network  | They are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks     |
Dimensionality Reduction   | Seek and exploit the inherent structure in the data, to summarize or describe data using less information.   |
Deep Learning              | A modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation|[D.L.](https://github.com/Luisa13/ML-Lab/tree/main/Deep%20Learning)
Instance-based             | Decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model |
